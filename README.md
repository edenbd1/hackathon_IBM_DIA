# **Track Sustainability**
### *Estimation and Simulation of the CO₂ Impact of LLM (Large Language Model) Queries*
**Hackathon IBM x ESILV**

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

As the use of generative AI continues to grow, its environmental impact has become a key concern.  
**Track Sustainability** provides a solution to **measure and visualize the carbon footprint of a query executed on a Large Language Model (LLM)**.

The goal is to **raise awareness** among users about the energy consumption and CO₂ emissions associated with AI usage, while offering **clear and relatable comparisons** (e.g., equivalent kilometers by car, duration of lighting a bulb, etc.).

## 🧠 Project Overview

We are developing an **interactive web application** that looks just like a standard LLM chat interface.

When a user submits a request:

1. The request is processed by a pre-trained model capable of **estimating the energy cost** of handling the query.
2. This estimated cost is **converted into CO₂ emissions**.
3. The app **displays a visual comparison** to help the user understand the impact of their query.

The project leverages the **WatsonX** platform for model interaction, computation, and performance evaluation.
